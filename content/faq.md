### What is St Columba's Day, Belfast?

It's an event celebrating open culture, focused around artistic and other creative works with open licenses, to enable sharing and collaboration.

Uniquely, we will ask all attendees to sign a waiver on entry that any copyright created or displayed during the event, not otherwise licensed under open license (see below), is released under the Creative Commons Share-Alike License 3.0. Additionally, there will be a `This means attendees can take photos, share them, record video and audio.

### What's an open license?

Everything from copyright-expired works to Creative Commons Share-Alike licenses. For simplicity, we generally mean Creative Commons compatible licenses, _not including_ those with non-commercial or no derivatives clauses.

### What isn't St Columba's Day, Belfast?

This isn't a statement against copyright enforcement, or against rights in creative works. We aren't saying that all works should be openly licensed at all times, any more than all concerts should be free at all times, or all private museums free at all times, say. But we do believe, for one event a year, creative minds can show the world that there is a value to creativity beyond money and intellectual property - this is the message of St Columba's Day, Belfast.

### Why are non-commercial licenses not considered open?

Some people do, others don't - for more of a discussion, [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#Criticism_of_the_non-commercial_license) is a good jumping off point.

For us, it is the idea that open licensing is defined by the decision of the creator, independent of the consumer - open is open to all.

### Won't people exploit my work?

Check out *What isn't St Columba's Day, Belfast* above - for us, exploitation is the abuse of a creator's rights. This event is about freely given participation, with no ambiguity - if you have something you are willing to share with the world, without wanting to hold back, we want to celebrate that, big or small. At the same time, we recognise that many of us depend on rights protection for our livings - this isn't exhaustive, just share the love of something you love if you can!

### So is this like freemium?

No, our focus is on quality. It doesn't have to be the world's best, but if you are going to participate, we expect it to be your first-rate work - that's the message we will be giving attendees, so even for your own commercial benefit, please make sure it's representative. Bear in mind, they are giving up their time to see what you can do - if you can't release something representative of your ability, which is fair enough, there might be other things you could do...

That all said, we're open to all skill levels so don't feel off-put by expectations - everyone's there in good faith, to explore the talent out there!

### If I can't show off my existing creations, what can I do?

Workshops, live performance/creation, tips talks, plenty!

### Can I participate without releasing any existing work?

Absolutely - if you have something to share, great
