      <description>On Sunday June 10, the day following St Columba&amp;rsquo;s Day, this event will run in Farset Labs in Belfast.
All are welcome - as described in the FAQ, it is an event celebrating artistic works and performance shared with the world by their creators. Original content, third-party openly licensed content, workshops and interviews welcome!
Please get in touch in advance if you would like some time or floor space, so we can plan the schedule for the day.</description>
